WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Every website can be split up into two

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
parts: the frontend and the backend.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The frontend is all the visual stuff

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
you see on the web page: the images, the

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
text, the buttons, and the backend is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
what saves and manages your data, for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
example your amazon order history. In

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this video I'm going to explain all the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
technologies that are used in the front

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
end of a web application, and in another

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
video we'll explore the backend let's

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
get started.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're going to start with a blank web

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
page and the first technology we're

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
going to look at is html. html stands for

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
hyper text markup language and is used

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to add content to our web page. For

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
example, I can write this bit of html to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
add a button.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I can also add other types of content,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
like images, and text and if I write more

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
html, it will add more content to my page.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But you'll notice that our page doesn't

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
look very good. That's where css comes in.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
css stands for cascading style sheets,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and based on the name, it's used to style

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
our web page, so it's used to make our

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
web page look good, by letting us adjust

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
colors, sizes, spacing, things like that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's add some css to our page.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So now that looks much better, but we're

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
not done here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's say that I want to filter these

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
products, and only show one brand of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
shoes, so I click this checkbox.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But you'll notice that nothing happens

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and this is where javascript comes in.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
html and css only display things on our

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
web page, but javascript is what makes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
our web page interactive.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So for example, when we click something,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and type something, a bit of javascript

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
code will update the page based on what

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we did.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The most important feature of javascript

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is something called the document object

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
model, or the dom.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The dom allows javascript to change the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
web page.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For example, this bit of javascript code

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
uses the dom to change the text in the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
button.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And this is how javascript makes pages

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
interactive.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
However, using the dom directly like this

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is really repetitive, and hard to manage

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that's why we use a javascript

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
framework.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Javascript frameworks give us a much

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
nicer way to create our web page, and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
they take care of updating the page for

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
us, so we never use the dom directly

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
anymore.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The most popular ones are react.js,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
angular, and vue.js.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now let's take a step back, and look at

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
javascript again.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Javascript as a language is missing a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
lot of features that other programming

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
languages have.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
One of these features is being able to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
split up our code into different files,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and to organize our code.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To solve this we have to use something

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
called a bundler. The most popular one

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you've probably heard of is called

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
webpack.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Webpack lets us split up our javascript

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
code into many different files, and once

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we're ready to put it on our website,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
webpack will combine all of these files,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
or bundle all of these files into one

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
javascript file that we can put on our

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
website.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Another tool that we use is called a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
transpiler. The most popular one you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
probably heard of is called typescript.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
A transpiler adds extra features onto

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
javascript. It lets us write an enhanced

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
version of javascript, and then once

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we're done it will transform the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
enhanced javascript back into normal

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
javascript because browsers like google

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
chrome can only understand normal

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
javascript.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So those are the major technologies in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the javascript world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now we're going to move over to css.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
css as a language has the same problems

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
as javascript. We can't organize our code

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
into different files, and css is missing

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a lot of useful features, so we also use

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
a bundler and a transpiler for css.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There's a special name for this called a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
css preprocessor. It's basically the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
combination of a bundler and a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
transpiler. The most popular css

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
preprocessor you probably heard of is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
called sass.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
sass lets us organize our css into

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
different files, and it lets us write

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
enhanced css,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and then it will bundle all those files

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
together into one file, and it will

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
transform the enhanced css back into

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
normal css. So you can think of it sort

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of like a bundler and a transpiler

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
combined. Now, once we had css

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
preprocessors, developers start to create

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
css frameworks, the most popular one

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
being bootstrap.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
css frameworks are basically a whole

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
bunch of css code that someone else

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
wrote, and it helps us solve common

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
problems, so using a framework like

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
bootstrap saves us a lot of time.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The last thing we're going to look at is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
how does the frontend communicate with

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the backend?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
For example let's say I'm on amazon and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I want to make an order. How does this

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
order get sent from my computer to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
amazon?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Javascript has a feature for this too

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
called XMLHttpRequest. It lets us send

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
a message, in this case we're going to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
send our amazon order, to a url like

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
amazon.com/

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
create-order. On the other side, amazon's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
backend is listening for these messages

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
sent to this url and that's how they get

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
our order. We're going to talk more about

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
this process in our backend video that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you can find in the description.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Over the years we've improved on

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
XMLHttpRequest and these days we use tools

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
like axios or fetch to send messages to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
the backend.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Alright, so these are all the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
technologies we need to build the frontend.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You'll notice that it's really just

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
html, css, and javascript. The other

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
technologies make css and javascript

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
easier to work with. Let me know in the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
comments how many of these technologies

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you already knew, and if anything was new

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to you. Thanks for watching, my name is
