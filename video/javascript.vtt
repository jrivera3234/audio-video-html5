00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey it's, Simon from supersimple.dev

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today's video is about a really

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
important topic if you want to get a job

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
as a web developer.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So we're going to talk about what are

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
javascript frameworks

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and which one should you learn. So pretty

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
much every web developer

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
uses a framework in addition to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
javascript to build web applications,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and here's my detailed explanation of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
what a framework is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So the first thing you need to know is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the basics of javascript.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now if you don't know javascript yet I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have an in-depth tutorial on javascript

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the link to that is in the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
description.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, I assume that you know javascript at

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
this point.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So a javascript framework helps you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
render stuff.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's a rendering system. Rendering means

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
displaying something on a web page.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's the most common thing you do in web

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
development.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So for example, if I want to render a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
button on my web page,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I can use this code and this is just

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
html we don't even need javascript yet.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now let's say that I have a list and I

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
want to render this list

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on my web page. Well we'll use javascript

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
here to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
loop through this list and for each item

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we're going to create an html element,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then add that element to the page. So

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that's rendering using javascript.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So a very common task in web development

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is: we're going to take some complex data

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we're going to use javascript to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
render that data on the web page.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For example let's say that we have a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
list of comments on a youtube

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
video and we want to render it to look

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
like this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In the beginning there were no

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
frameworks so developers just use

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
plain javascript to render data so this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is the code to render the comments using

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
plain javascript, and this is the code

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
using a framework. So as you can see

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this code is way easier to read and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
write. You can even see the structure of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the html

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that you're rendering. So if you use a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
javascript,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
framework you can write your code like

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
this, and then the framework basically

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
converts it into this javascript

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for you. And that javascript is going to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
render it on the page.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So that's why web developers use

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
frameworks, it makes our code

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so much more simple. Now let's go through

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a demo of a real

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
framework and this is how to use a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
framework. So first we have to go to the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
frameworks

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
website and every framework has their

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
own website. So if you don't know what

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we're going to search it in google, so we

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
can search backbone.js.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now once we're on the website we're

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
going to find a copy of the framework's

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
code,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so a framework is just a bunch of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
javascript code

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that someone else wrote, it's no

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
different than the code that you write

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
yourself.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So we're going to copy all of this code,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and run it in our web page.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So an easy way to do this is just to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
copy this url

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then in our web page we can add a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
script tag

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and we're going to give the script tag

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
an src attribute.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So this s r c attribute stands for the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
source attribute.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It will grab a copy of the code found in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this url,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
which is all of the frameworks code, and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it's going to run this code.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So we're going to run the frameworks

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
code at the top of our website

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that's it. Now you can start writing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
your web pages like this,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and the framework will convert it into

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
javascript and render things

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
for you. Of course you have to follow the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
instructions for how to use the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
framework,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so we would have to go back to the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
website and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
read all the instructions for how to use

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And a warning if this is your first time

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
learning about frameworks, these

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
instructions can be very hard to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
understand.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If you have any questions you can email

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
me supersimple.dev/feedback

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
or leave a comment below. So now that we

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
have a general sense of what a framework

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
looks like we're going to break down the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
three main parts of a framework.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So the first part is rendering, which we

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just talked about.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We write our code like this and this is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
also known as templating,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we're writing an html template where the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
values are filled by our data,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and then the framework takes it, converts

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it into javascript, which

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
then renders our web page. So the second

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
feature of a framework is data handling.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So all frameworks have a way for you to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
put your data in the framework.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And then it will take the data, and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
render it for you according to your web

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
page.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So it will take the values in your data,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and then fill your template with those

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
values.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then when the data changes, for

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
example we add or remove a comment,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the framework will automatically

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
re-render for you so that your web page

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is always

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
up to date with your data. So the third

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
feature of a framework is called event

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
handling,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
which means it helps you add event

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
handlers to your page so instead of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
writing button.onclick

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in javascript, the framework gives you an

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
easy way to add event handlers to your

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
html elements.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is also known as the mvc

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
architecture, or model

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
view controller, and this is what the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
majority of javascript frameworks are

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
built on.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And this is why if you have a good grasp

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of mvc, you shouldn't have much trouble

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
learning a framework and switching from

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
one framework

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to another. If you want to learn more

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
about mvc, we built an mvc-based app in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
my javascript beginner

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
tutorial, but I'll also make a specific video

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
about

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
mvc in the future, so please subscribe

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for that.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now while you're at it if you got value

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
from this video please click that like

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
button below so this video reaches more

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
people

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and helps people get tech careers. So

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
these are the three main features of a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
framework, some of them provide more

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
features than this,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
but all frameworks have these three

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
features.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So the second part of this lesson is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
which framework should you learn if you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
want to get a job as a web developer.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So in 2021, the front end frameworks you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
should consider

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
are react, vue, or angular and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
avoid other front-end frameworks.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Frameworks are created in generations

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
just like an iphone you have the first

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
generation, the second gen,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
etc if you want to get a job you need to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
learn the latest generation of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
javascript frameworks.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Because just like an iphone, everyone

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
wants to use the latest generation,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
or they want to upgrade, so right now

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
react, vue, and angular are the latest

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
generation of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
frameworks, and that's why you should

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
pick one of these to learn.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So the links to each of these frameworks

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
are in the description, you can take a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
look at them and see which one

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
interests you. So how long will it be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
before a new generation comes out

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and these frameworks become outdated?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Well the truth is that no one knows for

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
sure,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
but I'll let you know as soon as it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
happens so please be sure to subscribe.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So of these three frameworks which one

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
should you learn?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So the way this works is frameworks tend

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to be popular in certain regions.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So pick the framework that is the most

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
popular in the region you want to work

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
For example in the bay area and toronto,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
where I've worked companies like to use

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
react, so I've been using react. And it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
might be different for you.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So what I do to figure this out is I go

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
on linkedin or your country's job search

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
website,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then I search for web developer jobs

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
in the location that I want to work.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And then I make a list of which

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
frameworks come up most often,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and I learn that one. And if there's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
two that come up equally as often,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
then you can try them out both and see

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
which one you like

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
better. So that's the end of this lesson.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Thanks so much for watching the video,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
today we learned what is a javascript

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
framework and which one should you learn

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
if you want to get a job as a web

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
developer.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So each framework has a step-by-step

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
guide on how to set it up

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and you can take a look at them in the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
description.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
